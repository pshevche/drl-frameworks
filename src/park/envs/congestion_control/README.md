# Congestion control

This environment builds on top of CCP (https://github.com/ccp-project). We test it with linux kernel 4.13. The Vagrant file in this folder
provides a reproducible build environment. To use it, move the Vagrant file to agent folder (park root directory for now, TODO update it,
and cd /park_agent), and run
```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /park
```
